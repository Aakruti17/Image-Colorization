# Image-Colorization
This project demonstrates how to colorize black and white images using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging OpenCV and Python, this application takes grayscale images as input and produces colorized outputs that can be visually compelling. The project includes features such as a deep learning model that predicts colorization from grayscale images, efficient image processing capabilities through OpenCV, and a simple command-line interface for user convenience.
To run this project, you will need Python along with several libraries including OpenCV, PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the model used), NumPy, and opencv-python. You can install the required libraries using pip. To get started, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory. After installing the dependencies, download or train a pre-trained model for colorization and place the model file in the appropriate directory.
